# SuperStore Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing sales data from a SuperStore using **Power BI**, **Excel**, and **DAX** to provide actionable insights into sales trends and performance. With a dataset of 5902 records, I utilized advanced techniques for **time series forecasting**, **dashboard creation**, and **data visualization**, helping to drive business decisions.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Data Analysis**: Microsoft Excel, DAX
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI
- **Techniques**: Time Series Analysis, Sales Forecasting, Interactive Dashboard

## Dataset
The dataset contains 5902 records from the SuperStore, providing detailed insights into orders, customer information, and product performance.

- **Data Headers**:
  - Row ID, Order ID
  - Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode
  - Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment
  - Country, City, State, Region
  - Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name
  - Sales, Quantity, Profit, Returns, Payment Mode

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
1. **Data Validation**: Removed inconsistencies such as duplicates and incomplete records.
2. **Date Standardization**: Converted dates to a consistent format for time series analysis.
3. **Calculated Columns**: Used DAX in Power BI to create calculated columns for cumulative sales, profit margins, and order-to-ship time.

## Analysis & Insights
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Predicted future sales using historical data. The model showed projected growth in Q3, identifying periods of high and low demand.
- **Sales Performance**: Analyzed by region, product category, and customer segment, identifying top contributors and underperforming areas.
- **Profit Analysis**: Focused on maximizing profit by reviewing return rates and evaluating performance by product category.
- **Shipping & Customer Trends**: Analyzed shipping modes and customer segments to optimize shipping strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

### Key Insights
1. **Top Categories**: The **Furniture** category yielded the highest profit margins, whereas **Office Supplies** saw the highest volume of sales.
2. **Regional Performance**: The **East Coast** regions consistently outperformed other regions in terms of sales volume, while the **West Coast** had higher returns.
3. **Customer Segments**: **Corporate** customers contributed to 35% of total sales but had the lowest return rates, suggesting a more stable customer base.

## Dashboard
An interactive **Power BI dashboard** was developed to visualize key metrics:
- **Total Sales and Profit**: Filtered by region, product category, and customer segment.
- **Forecasted Sales**: A time series forecast chart showing predicted sales for the next quarter.
- **Returns and Profit Margins**: Visualizing the impact of product returns on profitability.
  
### Dashboard Features:
- **Slicers and Filters** for interactive exploration of data by segment, region, or date.
- **Custom Visualizations** created with DAX to highlight key trends.

## Learning & Outcomes
- Developed expertise in **Power BI** for creating **interactive dashboards** and using **DAX** for complex calculations.
- Gained practical experience in **time series forecasting** to predict sales patterns.
- Enhanced understanding of sales performance and **data-driven decision-making** in retail.
